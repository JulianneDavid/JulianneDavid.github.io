excerpt: "About Me..."
---
I am a graduate student in the [Computational Biology Program](https://www.ohsu.edu/school-of-medicine/computational-biology) and [Department of Biomedical Engineering](https://www.ohsu.edu/school-of-medicine/biomedical-engineering) at [Oregon Health & Science University](http://ohsu.edu/). I work in the [PDXgx group](https://github.com/pdxgx), co-mentored by [Abhi Nellore](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XxPWj5oAAAAJ) and [Reid Thompson](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tENxs6QAAAAJ). My work focuses on improving detection and identification of alternative and [aberrant splicing](https://academic.oup.com/narcancer/article/2/1/zcaa001/5717177) in RNA-seq data, with applications in cancer immunotherapy and early detection. 

#### Current Projects:
- Evaluating detection methods and filter parameters for calling [cancer-specific exon-exon junctions](https://academic.oup.com/narcancer/article/doi/10.1093/narcan/zcaa001/5717177), collaboratively with the [Gunnar Rätsch group](https://bmi.inf.ethz.ch/) at ETH Zürich.
- Leveraging sample-paired short- and long-read RNA sequencing data from the [SRA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) to evaluate short-read intron retention calling.
