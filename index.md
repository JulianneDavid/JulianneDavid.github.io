I am a graduate student in the [Computational Biology Program](https://www.ohsu.edu/school-of-medicine/computational-biology) and [Department of Biomedical Engineering](https://www.ohsu.edu/school-of-medicine/biomedical-engineering) at [Oregon Health & Science University](http://ohsu.edu/). I work in the [PDXgx group](https://github.com/pdxgx), co-mentored by [Abhi Nellore](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XxPWj5oAAAAJ) and [Reid Thompson](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tENxs6QAAAAJ). My work focuses on improving detection and identification of alternative and aberrant splicing in RNA-seq data, with applications in cancer immunotherapy and early detection. 

## Current Projects:
- Evaluation of filter parameters for calling cancer-specific exon-exon junctions
- Improving detection of retained introns
